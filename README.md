Live Emotion Recognition ðŸŽ­

This project uses DeepFace and OpenCV to perform real-time emotion recognition through a webcam.
It captures frames from the webcam, detects faces, analyzes emotions, and displays the dominant emotion on screen.

Features

Real-time emotion recognition using DeepFace

Supports multiple emotions such as happy, sad, angry, fear, surprise, neutral, and disgust

Draws bounding boxes around detected faces

Displays dominant emotion above each face

Press 'q' or 'Esc' to quit the application

Requirements

Python 3.7+

OpenCV

DeepFace

TensorFlow / Keras (installed automatically with DeepFace)

Installation

Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/live-emotion-recognition.git

Navigate to the project folder:
cd live-emotion-recognition

Install dependencies:

python emotion_recognition.py

The webcam window will open.

Detected faces will be highlighted with a green rectangle.

The predicted dominant emotion will appear above the face.

Press 'q' or 'Esc' to exit.
